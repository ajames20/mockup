  1. Reading documentation is key when needing to find something you may not have down by memory.
  2. Translating the document into HTML was not as difficult as once imagined.
  3. Maybe it wasn't difficult but being meticulous is important so, being patient was a bit difficult. Wanting to complete the project and go to the next task is a place of focus for me.
  4. Looking through documentation to answer a problem is useful. Being resilient when faced with a challenge is paramount.
